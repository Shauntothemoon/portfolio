      <description>By introducing this project, I would like to discuss an interesting and simple question I encountered while working on funnel optimization:
Should the funnel dashboards really look like a funnel?
This project is in fact a relatively tiny dashboard I built and redesigned for the funnel optimizations of a product from our organization. Though it may look tiny, it has been used for the stakeholder&amp;rsquo;s regular reporting as a sole source of truth for funnel traffics - which means it will be used as a data visualization in slides, many, many, many times.</description>
