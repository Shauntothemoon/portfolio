      <description>As a web analyst, the most important thing recently for my is the sunsetting of Universal Analytics - from July 1, 2023, it will stop processing data (though the data itself will be kept for at least other 6 months , which means all preparations should be done as soon as possible.
Therefore, I was looking for methods to efficiently backup the Universal Analytics&amp;rsquo; reports for my organization. However, as you may imagine (or you might be even facing the similar problem!</description>

      <description>By introducing this project, I would like to discuss an interesting and simple question I encountered while working on funnel optimization:
Should the funnel dashboards really look like a funnel?
This project is in fact a relatively tiny dashboard I built and redesigned for the funnel optimizations of a product from our organization. Though it may look tiny, it has been used for the stakeholder&amp;rsquo;s regular reporting as a sole source of truth for funnel traffics - which means it will be used as a data visualization in slides, many, many, many times.</description>

      <description>Before you read&amp;hellip; This is in fact a case study that I conducted during my master program, which puts a huge emphasis on reflecting how extensively used data could cause more - instead of less - systematical violence. It received 9, a very high mark in the Dutch higher education system, and is currently used by my professor as an example for future students.
Though I am now working towards a career in data analysis and strategies, the academic trainings I received always help me be mindful of consequences of what I (or we) could cause with data.</description>
