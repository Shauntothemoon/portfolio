<h3 id="highlight-start-each-day-by-choosing-a-focal-point">Highlight: Start Each Day by Choosing a Focal Point</h3>
<p>The first step in Make Time is deciding what you want to make time <em>for</em>.</p>
<p>Every day, you’ll choose <strong>a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar.</strong></p>

<h3 id="energize-use-the-body-to-recharge-the-brain">Energize: Use the Body to Recharge the Brain</h3>
<p>To achieve focus and make time for what matters, your brain needs energy, and that energy comes from taking care of your body.</p>
<p>That’s why the third component of Make Time is to <strong>charge your battery with exercise, food, sleep, quiet, and face-to-face time.</strong></p>
<h3 id="reflect-adjust-and-improve-your-system">Reflect: Adjust and Improve Your System</h3>
<p>Finally, before going to bed, you’ll <strong>take a few notes.</strong> It’s super simple: You’ll decide which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.</p>
<p>And you’ll think back on your energy level, whether you made time for your Highlight, and what brought you joy in the day.</p>
<p>Over time, you’ll build a customized daily system tailored to your unique habits and routines, your unique brain and body, and your unique goals and priorities.</p>
<h3 id="the-make-time-tactics-pick-test-repeat">The Make Time Tactics: Pick, Test, Repeat</h3>
<p>You don’t necessarily have to try something new every day. If what you’re doing is working, keep it up! But if it isn’t or if you think it could work better still, each day is a chance to experiment. Your version of the Make Time system will be totally personalized, and because you built it yourself, you’ll trust it, and it will fit into your existing lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="no-perfection-required">No Perfection Required</h3>
<p>We’d like you to forget the idea of perfection when it comes to Make Time. Don’t even try to do it perfectly—there’s no such thing! But there’s also no way to screw it up. And you won’t have to start over if you “fall off the wagon,” because each day is a clean slate.</p>
