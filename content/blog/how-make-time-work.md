1. Make Time Is Just Four Steps, Repeated Every Day
3. The first step is choosing a single **highlight** to prioritize in your day.
4. Next, you’ll employ specific tactics to stay **laser-focused** on that highlight
5. Throughout the day, you’ll build **energy** so you can stay in control of your time and attention.
6. Finally, you’ll **reflect** on the day with a few simple notes.


### Highlight: Start Each Day by Choosing a Focal Point

The first step in Make Time is deciding what you want to make time _for_.

Every day, you’ll choose **a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar.**


### Laser: Beat Distraction to Make Time for Your Highlight

### Energize: Use the Body to Recharge the Brain

To achieve focus and make time for what matters, your brain needs energy, and that energy comes from taking care of your body.

That’s why the third component of Make Time is to **charge your battery with exercise, food, sleep, quiet, and face-to-face time.**


### Reflect: Adjust and Improve Your System

Finally, before going to bed, you’ll **take a few notes.** It’s super simple: You’ll decide which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.

And you’ll think back on your energy level, whether you made time for your Highlight, and what brought you joy in the day.

Over time, you’ll build a customized daily system tailored to your unique habits and routines, your unique brain and body, and your unique goals and priorities.

### The Make Time Tactics: Pick, Test, Repeat

You don’t necessarily have to try something new every day. If what you’re doing is working, keep it up! But if it isn’t or if you think it could work better still, each day is a chance to experiment. Your version of the Make Time system will be totally personalized, and because you built it yourself, you’ll trust it, and it will fit into your existing lifestyle.

### No Perfection Required

We’d like you to forget the idea of perfection when it comes to Make Time. Don’t even try to do it perfectly—there’s no such thing! But there’s also no way to screw it up. And you won’t have to start over if you “fall off the wagon,” because each day is a clean slate.

### The “Everyday” Mindset
