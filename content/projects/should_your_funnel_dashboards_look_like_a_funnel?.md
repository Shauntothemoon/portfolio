By introducing this project, I would like to discuss an interesting question I encountered while working on funnel optimization:

Should the funnel dashboards really **look** like a funnel?

This project is in fact a relatively tiny dashboard I built and redesigned for the funnel optimizations of a product from our organization. Though it may look tiny, it has been used for the stakeholder's regular reporting as a sole source of truth for funnel traffics - which means it will be used as a data visualization in slides, many, many, many times.

And it now looks like this:

(I used a pdf editor to alter numbers in it, so the numbers may look a bit weird.)

Wait... it does not even look like a funnel, right?
